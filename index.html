    <h1>seals are absolutely adorable</h1>
    <h6>we should all appreciate them more</h6>
    <p>cool seal facts: </p>
 <p>1. seals like to sleep a meter underwater or deeper </p>
 <p>2. crabeater seals have funny shaped teeth because they are filter feeders </p>
 <p>3. their eyes are well adapted to water but they mostly hunt by feel with their whiskers </p>
 <p>4. they slap their belly to tell other seals/humans that they're on their territory and they need to back off </p>
 <p>5. their noses are almost always closed like they need to be manually opened by their muscles bc obviously they need to be watertight  </p>
 <p>6. they always have cold feet :( </p>
 <p>7. a group of seals is called a bob  </p>
 <p>8. the eyes of the baikal seals are so big bc they are adapted to using sunlight to hunt at a depth up to 100m in the clear waters of lake baikal while other species rely on their whiskers </p>
